This repo will hold the code to get the boost libraries working on iOS devices. 

For now this repo is based off of : 
    https://github.com/danoli3/ofxiOSBoost

I will have this repo, added as a submodule to the iOS project, and make changes in this 
project when I move towards a better boost build. 

The library that I am linking aganist the libboost.a is huge. It is 79MB.
    I need to use the bcp tool to select the parts of boost that I need. 
    But for the beta this is good enough. 

For the apple's ENABLE_BITECODE FLAG to work with boost, you have to run the build scrip 
	with Bitcode in its name. 
	The binary that this produces is 230 MB, so, can't store it on github. 
	TODO: The current way of handling boost including the whole project will not work for the 
	production app. 


Note : There will be erros with the build scrips if the xcode-select path is not set corrently. 
Do this if the project is to work : 
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app
