This repo will hold the code to get the boost libraries working on iOS devices. 

For now this repo is based off of : 
    https://github.com/danoli3/ofxiOSBoost

I will have this repo, added as a submodule to the iOS project, and make changes in this 
project when I move towards a better boost build. 

The library that I am linking aganist the libboost.a is huge. It is 79MB.
    I need to use the bcp tool to select the parts of boost that I need. 
    But for the beta this is good enough.
